        <p class="details">Hi, I am Shikha and I live in Short Hills, NJ.<br></p>

         <p class="details"> I am currently working on my Data Analytics certificate 
        from the continuing education program of Rutgers, the state university of New Jersey.
        I am thoroughly enjoying all the concepts taught in the class and I find data 
         analytics both stimulating as well as rewarding.<br></p>

        <p class="details">I am comfortable with a fast paced environment where deadlines are a priority
         and rapidly changing tasks are common. I enjoy learning from my peers and love 
         providing useful insights where needed.<br></p>
        <p class="details">I have taken last few years off to take care of my children  and now I am ready to 
        embark upon  and focus on my career.<br></p>
        <p>My data analytics and application development skills are up to the mark as I have 
        done my best to refresh my skills and keep up-to-date with the latest industry developments.<br></p>

         <p class="details">As a C++, C#, Java, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript  developer, I have worked with all aspects of 
        developing applications including coding, debugging and writing documentation. I feel that I can 
        tie my developer skills with the data analytics capabilities and bring a very useful set of tools 
        to the table.<br><br><br></p>
